AutoWifi - by dead1

WiFi Auditing
Bash script for analyzing and collecting EAPOL captures and PMK captures, with basic file management meant to simplify analyzing and moving captures from tool to tool.
AKA: Gathering and cracking wifi passwords.

I made it to simplify a project, so I'm sure it has flaws.
Im just trying to share it with my friends.

Tested and created on Kali
Can only be used in a VM if you're using a USB adapter you can passthrough.
Utilizes Aircrack-ng and HCXDumptool (https://github.com/ZerBea/) for captures.
REQUIRES A WIRELESS CARD OR ADAPTER

To download and install type:
Install script uses apt, Kali/Debian systems only
git clone https://github.com/deadone/autowifi.git
cd autowifi
chmod 700 install.sh
./install.sh
autowifi

It will check and install any missing dependencies/tools.
******* Uninstall script can be found in /opt/autowifi/uninstall.sh *******

You can install dependencies yourself if you dont wish to use the install script.
You can open the program by going to folder /opt/autowifi/, and typing: ./main

Required Tools:(installed with script)

* hashcat (https://github.com/hashcat)
* mdk3 (https://github.com/aircrack-ng/mdk3)
* aircrack-ng (https://www.aircrack-ng.org/)
* hcxdumptool (https://github.com/ZerBea/)
* hcxtools (https://github.com/ZerBea/)

Comes with a built in wordlist, and Kali comes with a built in version of rockyou.txt, copy any other desired wordlists in '/wordlists' directory.

Setting Up: When you start autowifi, first take note of "CONFIGURED". If it says NO!, select option [5] to put the interface correctly into monitor mode, and will allow the appropriate processes. If you wish to stop using the program, use option [6] to reset everything back to normal.

If you plan on using de-auth packets, it never hurts to randomize your MAC address. If you use option [7] it will correctly change and randomize your NIC's MAC address. If and when you want to return to your original MAC address, use option [8]

OPTION [1] - Focused capture. [EAPOL]

OPTION [2] - Passive capture. Sometimes takes a minute to grab something.[EAPOL + PMK]

If you use the install script captures will be saved in /opt/autowifi/handshakes & /opt/autowifi/pmk

Options:

[1] - EAPOL Capture. Will open a airodump capture on all channels so that you can see which channel your target(s) are on. Press Ctrl+C to close the window. Input the channel, and the name you want to give the capture file. You will then be asked if you want to run the Cannon. This is mkd3 packets sending De-Auth packets at a very high rate in order to force handshakes. Be advised, this is ILLEGAL unless authorized to do so. Press Ctrl+C when you have collected the handshake you want. It will ask you if you want to format the capture for hashing. Click yes if you wish to prepare the capture for your current computer or another hashing machine.

[2] - PMK + EAPOL Capture. Selecting this option will open a passive capture and doesnt cause any de-auth signals. It will collect PMK's and WPA handshakes. WPA's provide more information when cracked, but PMK's are easier to obtain. After you have collected the handshakes/pmks that you want, you can stop the capture by pressing Ctrl+C. You will then be able to see how many of each type you collected. I generally only format EAPOL.

[3] - Incase you accidently close the cannon when you are collecting with optioin [1], this will restart the mdk3 cannon.

[4] - The MAIN interface will tell you how many files of each type of capture you have and this is the option to use when you want to crack them on the current computer. It will open up hashcat, ask you what time, ask you which file (it will show you the the choices), and ask you if you want to use any rules (start with saying no). Hashcat will start, and inform you if or if it isnt sucessful. GOOD LUCK!

[9] - Use to make changes to the program; wordlists, interfaces, and delete all files of captures.

[XX] - I added an option to kill the computer, meaning shut it down. If you want to shut your computer down quickly, this is the best way.
